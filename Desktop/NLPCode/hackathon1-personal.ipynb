    "## Overview of the task\n",
    "For this first hackathon, your team will develop a model for distinguishing the speech of people who grew up in the **Northeastern US** (specifically, New England and New York City) from the speech of people who grew up in the **Western US** (the states on the US west coast and in the southwest). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The `wav` and `TextGrid` files can be found in the correspondingly named directories (`Northeast` and `West`). This data is a subset of the TIMIT database, which you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/philipperemy/timit). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "Below I have given you code that extracts some basic speech features and classifies with cross validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Baselines\n",
    "I've provided two baselines: the majority class baseline, and a baseline using the sorts of features we've  extracted before (mean pitch, mean intensity, duration, and mean F1 in vowel segments). I've used parselmouth here, but you are free to use Praat directly and then save out the features to files that you then read in with Python to do classification.\n",
